# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Movie App (React.js)
Developed a dynamic movie browsing web application using React.js with modern concepts such as React Hooks, Context API, and React Router for efficient state management and navigation. Integrated with TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch real-time movie data including details, search results, and trending lists. Implemented features like favorites management, search functionality, and responsive UI for a seamless user experience. Utilized Axios for API calls and modular component-based architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
